I lead a [Bass Connections](https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project/discovering-ai-applications-traumatic-brain-injury-care-2024-2025/) team at Duke University titled *Discovering AI Applications for Traumatic Brain Injury Care (2024–2025)*. This interdisciplinary project brought together 21 students and 6 faculty to explore how artificial intelligence can improve care for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)—a leading cause of death and disability, especially in young adults. We combined qualitative interviews with clinicians, clinical shadowing, and electronic health record (EHR) data analysis to identify actionable opportunities for AI in the TBI care pathway. On the qualitative side, students conducted 28 clinician interviews across emergency, ICU, surgical, and inpatient settings. Quantitatively, the team curated a large TBI dataset from Duke Health and developed data cleaning protocols, variable adjudication reports, and tools such as Sankey diagrams and NLP pipelines. Our work culminated in an interactive application, conference presentations, and planned publications. The experience has offered a rich foundation in healthcare innovation, applied machine learning, and collaborative leadership.
