I've been toying with making a blog for some time, and now it has done. Not sure how many people read blogs these days, but in any case, I'm hoping putting my thoughts together in blog form can help my own learning. If that happens to touch others in the process, all the better. 

What kind of content will I put here? I am guessing it will be more focused on stuff related to my PhD research, i.e. the intersection between AI and healthcare. Though I imagine my musings on baseball, movies, and other errata from my life may creep in.
