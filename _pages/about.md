I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Duke University in Durham, NC. In my research, I develop deep learning-based models for the prognosis of traumatic brain injury. I work closely with healthcare providers to understand the electronic health record data going into models, and to make sure that we're building something that is safe and useful! 

I grew up in New Jersey and received my BS from Rutgers University (go Scarlet Knights!) in Physics, and did a stint as an intern at Oak Ridge National Lab before coming to Duke. I'm a diehard Mets fan, and when I'm not working, I'm probably doing something baseball/softball-related.
